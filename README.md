This is my bespoke neovim setup. It's still a work in progress, but it includes all the minimal viable plugins (MVP).

### Get started

1. Make sure you have the following installed.

	- Neovim 0.9.5+ with LuaJIT 2.1.17+
	- Python 3
	- Go 1.20.x
	- Rust

2. Back up your `~/.config/nvim` folder, and then run the following command: 

	`$ git clone https://github.com/penzur/dotvim.git $HOME/.config/nvim`

3. Open `neovim` and run `:Lazy install`.

Enjoy!
